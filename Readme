There are a few projects I want to achieve in the BeCode training.
Firstly, I want to learn how to navigate and use Ubuntu 18.04.
Secondly, I want to learn about CSS, HTML, Java and PHP and train myself in using them.
I also want to use these languages to learn myself to create clean lines of code, sites and pages.
Lastly I want to become a real web developer!
